## Process
- Sprint start and end on Monday. On each Monday I will start with the Sprint Review, folloId by a brief Retrospective, and then I start the new Sprint.
- In the Sprint Review I briefly go over what I did in the past week and what problems I encountered.
- In the Sprint I document what my overall goals for the sprint are, which user stories I am going to work on.
- When a task is finished I assign myself to a new task.

### Definition of Done
A task is deemed complete when:
- All features have achieved production quality.
  
  The web app definition of done:
- The platform must be user-friendly and intuitive for both moderators and participants, with tasks resembling the physical game. It should support real-time interaction between players and moderators, mimicking the physical game environment. Anonymity should be optional to allow flexible game environments. Additionally, the platform must enable data storage, including game results and participant nationality, exportable in a CSV format for further analysis.

### Sprint Goals
- Achieve the definition of done.
- Satisfy stakeholders/ supervisors.
